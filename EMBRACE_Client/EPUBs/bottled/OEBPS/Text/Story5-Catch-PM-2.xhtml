    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s6">Lucas asked Olivia what she was holding, but she replied, “Nothing!” and she threw the bottle behind the bush to hide it.</p>
    
    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s7">“I don’t want to take your wish, Olivia. Can we just be friends?” asked the boy while picking up the bottle and handing it to her.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s8">“I would love to be friends!” she replied.  “I don’t need a wish anymore.”</p>
    
    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s9">“Catch!” Lucas yelled as he threw her the ball.</p>
    
    <p class="sentence" id="s10">From that day forward, the two friends were always together.</p>
    
    <p class="sentence" id="s11">By treating others with kindness and finding joy within himself, Lucas got exactly what he needed: someone to catch the ball.</p>
