    <p class="sentence" id="s1">Lucas felt silly for making a wish too quickly.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s2">He decided to think harder about his next one.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s3">All of this thinking made him sleepy, so he took a nap.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s4">When Lucas woke up, he knew exactly what to wish for!</p>
    
    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s5">He jumped out of bed and ran to tell Papa.</p>
    
    <p class="sentence" id="s6">"Papa, Papa, I want a little brother!" shouted Lucas.</p>
    
    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s7">Papa told the boy to sit and said, "Son, I have something very important to tell you: soon, you will have an adopted baby brother!"</p>
    
    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s8">Filled with excitement, Lucas ran circles around the room.</p>
