    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s1">"Follow me," said Papa as he picked up the baby and walked down the hill.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s2">"See the river," he continued, "its happiness does not come from things or wishes.  Instead, its joy comes from within."</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s3">Lucas understood and tossed the bottle and stone back into the water.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s4">"I do not need my last wish to be happy," he thought.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s5">Papa filled a cup with water from the river and told the boy one last thing, "By sharing its water, the river helps others, and that brings it joy."</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s6">The boy gave Papa a hug and said, "Thank you for your words of wisdom. I am so lucky to have you!"</p>
    
     <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s7">Lucas picked up his brother and went back to the house to play.</p>
