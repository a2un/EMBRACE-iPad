    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s1">It was Sunday. The judge walked to the cow.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s2">She tasted the cow's milk from the bucket.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s3">"Mmmm, that's really good milk," she said.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s4">Then the judge counted the chicken's eggs, "One, two, three, four!"</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s5">Next the judge walked to the pig.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s6">"You are the fattest pig in the world," she said.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s7">The judge walked to the corral door.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s8">The horse ran as fast as the wind and stopped next to the judge.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s9">The judge said to Farmer Manuel, "You have the best animals and the best farm in the country."</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s10">She gave Manuel the beautiful trophy.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s11">All of the animals cheered. They had worked together to become the best farm!</p>
