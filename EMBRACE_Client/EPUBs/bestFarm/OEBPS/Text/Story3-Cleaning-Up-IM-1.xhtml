    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s3">Manuel first put the horse and then the cow into the corral.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s4">He can clean the barn better with big animals in the corral.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s5">Then he put the pig into its pen.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s6">Manuel walked to the pumpkins.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s7">He wanted to be sure that there were no weeds in the pumpkin field.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s8">After checking the pumpkins, Manuel walked back to the barn.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s9">He picked up the hay and carried it to the hayloft.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s10">Oh no! Manuel fell off the hayloft, and the hay fell too.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s11">Manuel will have to rest inside for the next 3 days.</p>
